<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Freshly ground beef</li>
  <li>American cheese</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>You start by placing two two-ounce patties on the surface of a hot (and I mean hot) griddle. These are relatively high-fat patties (around 25% fat), made with a combination of short rib, brisket, and sirloin.</li>
  <li>We tried a whole host of instruments for smashing our patties before settling on a plastering trowel, which is essentially a steel plate attached to a wooden handle. It gives you good leverage, which is importantâ€”remember, we're smashing petite two-ounce patties down to a size that's wide enough to fit on a standard burger bun.</li>
  <li>Next up, the patties get seasoned with salt and pepper. When you've got great beef, this is the only additional flavoring it needs. Think of it as a suit and tie for your patties.</li>
</ol>
